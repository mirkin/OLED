SSD1306 driving 128x64 OLED via I2C
===================================

Found a handful of cheap OLED screens driven via I2C but the documentation
of the driver (SSD1306) was confusing.

Great opportunity to hack it, sending data and commands to come up with a way
to use the screen in any projects.

First breakthrough was when I sent enable charge pump command (0x8D)

Graphic Display Ram Mapping
===========================

Seems you can creep along the display in 8 pixel vertical strips which would
be cool for 8x8 sprites/fonts but pixel based drawing would be a pain. After
each byte the next vertical strip is moved one pixel horizontally until the end
of the screen when you are moved down a line.


You can set it to creep forward in vertical strips of 8 pixels and instead of
moving horizontally for the next vertical strip by 1, move vertically down 8
I quickly got X,Y bases pixel mapping working with this but it's not great for
chinks of pixels like sprites/fonts.
